module ActiveMailbox
  
  # Active Mailbox is my attempt to bring object-relational mapping Ã  la Active Record
  # (http://ar.rubyonrails.org) to IMAP mailboxes.
  #
  # The library provides a straight-forward interface to acces messages and mailboxes stored
  # on a number of IMAP servers, just like Active Record does to access relational databases.
  # There are some noteable differences to Active Record, however.
  #
  # == Domain Classes
  #
  # First of all, Active Mailbox provides exactly two different domain classes to work with: one
  # class to access your messages, and one class to access mailboxes (IMAP folders). Both are created
  # more or less automatically once a class derives from ActiveMailbox::Base, like this:
  #
  #   require 'active_mailbox'
  #   
  #   class MyClass < ActiveMailbox::Base
  #     folder_class :default
  #     message_class "MyPersonalMessageClass"
  #   end
  #
  # This will create two classes: <tt>MyClass::ImapFolder</tt> to access folders and
  # <tt>MyClass::MyPersonalMessageClass</tt> to access messages. There are only a few reasons why a
  # user would want to further modify either of these classes, but of course you're free to do so.
  # Just make sure that you don't break functionality by overwriting some crucial methods. For further
  # information, refer to the ActiveMailbox::Base::ImapFolder and ActiveMailbox::Base::ImapMessage
  # modules.
  #
  # As the upper example already implies, you can specify your own names for the domain classes by
  # passing a String to the macros <tt>folder_class</tt> and <tt>message_class</tt>, or alternatively
  # pass <tt>:default</tt> if you wish to stick with the standard names.
  #
  # == Data Sources
  #
  # Contrary to the Active Record library, Active Mailbox provides data sources (connections) on a
  # per-user base. This means that each potential user gets it's very own connection and that connections
  # don't have to be shared among users. In fact, a user can specify his or her very own IMAP server to
  # work with. This is especially useful if you want to write a distributed application where users are
  # supposed to create and manage their own accounts. And yes, you may allow one user to work with
  # multiple connections at once.
  #
  # However, this kind of flexibilty has its price. First of all, it requires you to establish
  # connections manually. To do so, you have to call the <tt>establish_connection</tt> method along with
  # the ID of the connection you want to use, like this:
  #
  #   MyClass.establish_connection(connection_id)
  #
  # Further, each call to one of the domain classes' class methods requires the ID of the connection you
  # want to use as the first parameter. For instance:
  #
  #   MyClass::MyFolder.find(connection_id, :all)
  #
  # And last but not least, you should close the connection once it's not needed anymore, using
  # <tt>disconnect!</tt>:
  #
  #   MyClass.disconnect!(connection_id)
  #
  # Active Mailbox also supports mechanisms to observe and terminate inactive connections after a certain
  # amount of time (connection timeout) has passed. You should really take care about this by yourself,
  # though. The main purpose of this feature is to get rid of connections that have previously been
  # established through user-interaction and have - for whatever reason - been abandoned (system crash,
  # browser or application closed without logging out, etc.)
  #
  # The good news is: once you have aquired an object from one of the domain classes, the connection ID
  # is stored in that object and must not be supplied anymore:
  #
  #   folder = MyClass::MyFolder.find(connection_id, :Trash)
  #   messages = folder.messages
  #
  # You may be wondering where to specify your actual connections. The answer is that it's up to you
  # where to specify them. I would suggest that they come from a relational database or a similar place,
  # maybe they are also coupled with your applications user accounts. Wherever they come from, you must
  # provide an interface to your account management to Active Mailbox. Have a look at the
  # ActiveMailbox::ImapAuthenticator module.
  #
  # == Connection Adapters
  #
  # Active Mailbox uses a collection of connection adapters to deal with different types of IMAP servers.
  # You are free to specify an adapter by yourself or alternatively let Active Mailbox chose one for you.
  # If the server doesn't provide any valuable information on its type, the ImapClassifier class will
  # apply various classification methods to it. There's a chance of failure to these methods however, so
  # you should probably encourage the user to play around with various drivers incase he encounters any
  # problems.
  #
  # You are also encouraged to provide your own adapter classes if a certain server type is not supported
  # natively. Generally speaking, any adapter must be derived from the
  # ConnectionAdapters::AbstractImapAdapter class. You may want to build your adapter on top of the
  # ConnectionAdapters::GenericAdapter though, which already implements a ton of functionality.
  # 
  # In order to use an adapter class, the class must register itself at the ConnectionAdapters::AdapterPool
  # class.
